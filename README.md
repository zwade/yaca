# YACA (Yet Another Calculator App)

## Setup

Setting up YACA is pretty straightforward.

First, if you don't have them yet, make sure you're on a relatively recent version of `node` and `yarn`.

Then, run the following

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

And now navigate your browser to `https://localhost:3838/`

## Idea

Nothing here until someone tests it. There aren't any real hints in the codebase so no worries about poking through it (this will probably be full source).
